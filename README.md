# autotranslate

We made a new website with english base.json. Now, we need to translate this to different languages.
    We grab base.json and convert it to excel file, hand this excel file to a translator. Give strict
    instructions - not to type some stuff that will break everything (new lines etc). 
    Once we have excel with the translations we can use this script to replace values with the translations.
